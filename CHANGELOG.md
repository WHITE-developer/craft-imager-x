## 3.4.0 - 2021-03-31

> {warning} Imager X now requires PHP 7.2.5 or newer.

> {warning} If you're using the ImageOptim optimizer, it have now been removed from core due to lack of support for PHP 8.0 in a required library. It is instead available as [a separate plugin](https://github.com/spacecatninja/craft-imager-x-imageoptim-optimizer). All you need to do is install it, no code or config changes needed.

### Changed
- Imager X now requires PHP 7.2.5 or higher.

- Added support for blurhash encoding both for local transforms (adresses #67), and through Imgix (adresses #86).
- Added support for returning a transform in blurhash "format" when using the GraphQL transformImage directive.

## 3.3.0 - 2021-01-31

> {warning} If you're using the Imgix transformer, and have added an API key to enable purging, you need to create a new one since [Imgix is deprecating their old API in March](https://blog.imgix.com/2020/10/16/api-deprecation). This version of Imager X supports both the old and the new version, but you will get a deprecation error if you use an old API key.
